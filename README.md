This is mainly meant as a backup to the code that I have developed for a node.js/mariadb project.

Due to its nature it is adviced to run the project over a locally hosted node.js server,
with a mariadb or mysql application running in the background.

dependencies include:

mysql2 -> to allow for communication between 
          the server hosted on node and the database

dotenv -> for a basic method of encryption 

express -> to deploy a dynamic website 
           capable of requesting information from 
           or making changes to the database
